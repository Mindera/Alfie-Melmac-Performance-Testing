## 2. Tasks List

- **T1:** Explore the concepts and fundamentals of non-functional requirements and performance in mobile applications.  

- **T2:** Hands-on on the internal mobile application project that will serve as a basis for applying the performance testing tool.  

- **T3:** Identify and document the requirements and features of the performance testing tool by collaborating with a development team of QAEs and Developers.  

- **T4:** Implement a performance testing task – evaluating one of the metrics identified - that will serve as a Proof of Concept (POC).  

- **T5:** Implement Database Model to record performance tests results.

- **T6:** Iterate on other implementations/metrics gathered and defined in T3 – depending on the results of iteration T4.  

- **T7:** Produce technical documentation and user guides on the final state of the implemented tool.  

- **T8:** Analyse the potential of the tool, notably identifying current advantages, improvements recorded in the projects where it was used, and identifying next iterations in the development.  

- **T9:** Produce Final Report for University.
