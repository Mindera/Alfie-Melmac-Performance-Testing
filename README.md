# Melmac Performance Testing

## 1. Description of the Project

As part of [Mindera's](https://mindera.com) internship program, we are developing a framework for testing the performance of mobile applications. The goal is to create a robust and industry-aligned solution that will help evaluate and optimize the performance of mobile apps. Over the course of this internship, we will focus on identifying key performance metrics, developing a testing framework, and analyzing the results to propose performance enhancements. Our work will contribute to Minderaâ€™s ongoing efforts to ensure that deliverables meet high industry standards and will provide valuable insights for future performance testing initiatives. This repository serves as the central hub for our internship project, containing initial source code, project management tools, and documentation to guide us through the process of building and refining the performance testing framework.
